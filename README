Let's create a small todo app with a custom component system!

You will need to:

 - Finish the code in the following files: "lib.js", "app.js" and "index.html"
 - Add some style to the app

The project will be tested in the following way:

 - npm install
 - npx serve
 - Browse http://localhost:3000 from Chrome or Firefox
 - Ensure that the app displays correctly and that the data from data.json are loaded
 - Test the creation, modification and deletion of tasks

During our debriefing interview, the following questions will be asked:

 - How did you approach the problem ?
 - What difficulties did you encounter ?
 - What are the limitations of this custom component system ?

Have fun!
